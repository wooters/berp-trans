# The Berkeley Restaurant Project (BeRP) Transcripts

This repository contains the most recent *transcripts* of the audio
files contained in the Berkeley Restaurant Project (BeRP) corpus. When
corrections come in, I will update this repository.

## BeRP Background

The Berkeley Restaurant Project (BeRP) was a testbed for a speech
recognition system developed by the International Computer Science
Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley, CA, USA, in the 1990's.

The BeRP system was designed to be an automated consultant whose domain
of knowledge was restaurants in the city of Berkeley. The system
served as a testbed for several research projects, including robust
feature extraction, neural-net based phonetic likelihood estimation,
automatic induction of multiple pronunciation lexicons, foreign accent
detection and modeling, advanced language models, and lip-reading.

The BeRP corpus, collected at ICSI, currently contains approximately
8566 utterances, with about 1900 unique words, comprising about 7
hours of speech. The audio data was recorded with a Sennheiser
close-talking microphone and was sampled at 16 kHz.

The entire ~443MB BeRP corpus (audio and transcripts) can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pubahogzscexz7d6zl58x/berp.tgz?rlkey=bdc0zj12a3w62xtdkp0zm5efd&st=4ravrg7k&dl=0).


## Transcriptions

Each line in the *transcript.txt* file contains the transcript for
a single audio file. The first token on each line is the base name
of the corresponding audio file. So, for example, the line containing
the transcript for the audio file *4F_1_0010.wav.gz* looks like this:

```
4F_1_0010 i wanna spend about five dollars
```

See the file *transcription_guidelines.txt* for the guidelines that
the human transcribers were supposed to follow when transcribing the
audio data. If you find any issues, please let us know so that we can
update the transcripts!

## Probabilistic Context-free Grammar Rules

In our BeRP paper from 1994, and the follow-on paper from 1995, we
mention "1389 hand-written context-free rules". While I could no
longer locate that specific set of 1389 rules, I was able to locate a
set of 1412 rules dated Aug 1995, which are included in this repo as:

`amer_trn2456_1412rules_aug95.cfg`

(Caveat: I have not verified that this cfg matches the transcripts in
this repo.)

## Misc

The file *wordhist.txt* contains a frequency count of all of the words
in the BeRP transcripts. It is generated with this command:

```bash
cut -d" " -f2- transcript.txt | tr " " '\012' | sort | \
  uniq -c | sort -rn > wordhist.txt
```
